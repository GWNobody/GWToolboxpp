**Salvify** is a plugin for [GWToolbox](https://github.com/gwdevhub/GWToolboxpp) for identifying and salvaging items in *Guild Wars*. The main feature provides a button and with just one click it will:

- **Identify** all unidentified items in your inventory.
- **Salvage** items according to your configured preferences.

This allows you to clean up your inventory quickly, efficiently, and with minimal effort.


## Features

- **One-click operation** – Identify and (optional) salvage in a single step.
- **Blacklist** - Exclude items from identifying and salvaging.
- **Salvage Popup** – A prompt asking you to salvage an item right after it’s identified.
- **Time-saving** – For players who want to focus more on gameplay and less on manual inventory management.

## How It Works

1. Configure the preference of the plugin in the settings.
2. Click the button.
3. Sit back as the plugin automatically identifies and salvages items based on your rules.


## Installation

1. Ensure [GWToolbox](https://github.com/gwdevhub/GWToolboxpp) is running.
2. Download the latest `Salvify.dll` from the [Releases](../../releases) page.
3. Place the DLL into your GWToolbox `plugins` folder.
